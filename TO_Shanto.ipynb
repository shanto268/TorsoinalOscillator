    "## Law of Universal Gravitation\n",
    "\n",
    "Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation proposed that the gravitational attraction between any two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers **[1]**. In equation form, this is often expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "F_g = G \\frac{m_1 m_ 2}{r^2} \n",
    "\\label{eq:Fg} \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant of proportionality in this equation is $G$ - the universal gravitation constant - and is $6.67384 x 10^{-11}  m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}$. The value of $G$ was not experimentally determined until nearly a century later (1798) by Lord Henry Cavendish using a torsion balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cavendish Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Cavendish's apparatus **[2]** for experimentally determining the value of $G$ involved a light, rigid rod about 2-feet long. Two small lead spheres were attached to the ends of the rod and the rod was suspended by a thin wire. When the rod becomes twisted, the torsion of the wire begins to exert a torsional force that is proportional to the angle of rotation of the rod. The more twist of the wire, the more the system pushes backwards to restore itself towards the original position. Cavendish had calibrated his instrument to determine the relationship between the angle of rotation and the amount of torsional force. A diagram of the apparatus is shown below.\n",

    "    <figcaption><b>Fig. 1:</b> Schematic of Cavendish Apparatus (Credit: GOOGLE)</figcaption>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Cavendish then brought two large lead spheres near the smaller spheres attached to the rod. Since all masses attract, the large spheres exerted a gravitational force upon the smaller spheres and twisted the rod a measurable amount. Once the torsional force balanced the gravitational force, the rod and spheres came to rest and Cavendish was able to determine the gravitational force of attraction between the masses. By measuring $m_1, m_2, d$ and $F_g$, the value of $G$ could be determined. Cavendish's measurements resulted in an experimentally determined value of $6.75 x 10^{-11} N m^2/kg^2$. Today, the currently accepted value is $6.67259 x 10^{-11} N m^2/kg^2$.\n"

    "### Experimental Set Up\n",

    "We have devised a set up similar to a Cavendish Apparatus with the use of a TeachSpin Torsional oscillator, a mirror, measuring rule, and a laser (see **Section 3**)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The laser is reflected off a mirror, which rotates with the pendulum (the hanging masses in our set up). This causes\n",
    "a laser pointer dot to slowly track back and forth across the opposing wall of our\n",
    "lab. The dynamics of these oscillations are used to determine $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the laser was aligned, measurements\n",
    "were taken, every 30s, from the centre of the stripe\n",
    "along the tape measure scale. A measuring tape\n",
    "was affixed to the\n",
    "wall such that the\n",
    "stripe tracks along it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key feature\n",
    "of the experiment\n",
    "is to measure the\n",
    "difference in equilibrium\n",
    "positions of the laser spot\n",
    "when the large mass\n",

    "After talking to Kim about our issue, he said that he could possibly fix the Torsional Balance apparatus. He found an extra torsion wire in his supplies and he took the apparatus in the shop to work on it. He insisted that he perform the procedure himself rather than us since there is only one wire left and there is no room for error. Kim returned to room 030 and was asking if we saw a \"small copper holder screw\" that he accidentally dropped while transporting the apparatus. We searched for an hour and it is nowhere to be found (it is really thin and light). Kim assured us that it he probably had a replacement and left.\n",

    "Four hours later, Kim brought back the apparatus. He, sadly, had snapped the torsion wire since it was a very tricky procedure so he decided to use a fine **0.2337 mm** copper wire instead. Due to the ductile nature of the copper wire, it will stretch due to the weight of the hanging masses and he instructed us how to restore the hanging mass system to default if it does so by loosening and pulling the top screw.\n",
    "\n",
    "He further showed us how to manipulate the equipment to conduct our experiment. He has advised us to **handle the apparatus very gently** and **to always lock the masses before moving the apparatus**. This is crucial to make sure the apparatus is functioning and not out of order since torque of the hanging masses will snap the wire. He also asked us to report our best finding to him so that he can assess the viability of using copper wires instead of the  standard *torsion wire* to carry out this experiment.\n",

Thus, the gravitational constant calculated would be off by some correction factor that accounts for this phenomenon. There is also uncertainties in the fit values as well.\n",
